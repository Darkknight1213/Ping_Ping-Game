# Ping Pong Game

This is a simple Ping Pong game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The game allows two players to control paddles and score points by bouncing a ball across the screen.

## Features

- **Two-player game**: Control paddles on the left and right sides.
- **Score Tracking**: The scoreboard updates in real-time, tracking points for each player.
- **Responsive Controls**: Move paddles up and down to bounce the ball.
- **Ball Physics**: Ball speed increases with each bounce, making the game more challenging.
